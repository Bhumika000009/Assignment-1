        "Dispersion refers to the spread or variability of data points around the central tendency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variance: Measures the average squared difference of each data point from the mean. A higher variance indicates greater spread.\n",
        "Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance. Provides a more interpretable measure of spread in the original units of the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "A box plot (also called a box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical representation of the distribution of data based on five key summary statistics: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum.\n",
        "\n",
        "A box plot can tell you about:\n",
        "\n",
        "Central tendency: The median is shown by a line inside the box.\n",
        "Dispersion: The interquartile range (IQR = Q3 - Q1) is represented by the box's length, showing the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\n",
        "Skewness: The position of the median within the box and the lengths of the whiskers indicate if the data is skewed (asymmetrical).\n",

        "\n",
        "Random sampling is a crucial technique in statistics where each member of a population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its role in making inferences is:\n",
        "\n",
        "Representativeness: A random sample is more likely to be representative of the larger population, meaning it reflects the characteristics of the population accurately.\n",
        "Generalizability: Because of this representativeness, findings from a random sample can be generalized (or inferred) to the broader population with a certain level of confidence.\n",
        "Reducing Bias: Random sampling helps minimize bias, ensuring that the sample isn't skewed towards specific subgroups within the population.\n",
        "In short, random sampling enables us to draw conclusions about an entire population based on the analysis of a smaller, randomly selected subset."

        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Skewness refers to the asymmetry of the distribution of data. It indicates whether the data is concentrated more on one side of the mean than the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Skewness:\n",

        "Impact on Interpretation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Skewness can distort the interpretation of data because it affects measures of central tendency. For instance, in a positively skewed distribution, the mean is typically greater than the median, which can lead to overestimation if the mean is used as the central measure.\n",
